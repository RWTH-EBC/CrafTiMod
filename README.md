# CrafTiMod

This repository contains data for realization times of modernization measures for residential buildings by craftworkers. Measures comprise insulation of different envelope components as well as changing the heat supply system. The realization time data was generated by the conduction of expert interviews. This repository also includes the interview guidelines.

## Files

This repository contains the following files and folders which are all described in the paper in detail: 

- '''realization_times.xlsx''':
	> Realization times by modernization measure. The file contains all interview data, divided into one sheet per modernization measure.
- '''raw_data_csv''':
